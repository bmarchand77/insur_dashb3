Advice from Forum
Potential Issues and Fixes:
1.	Compatibility of Python Dependencies:
   a. Problem: If the dependencies in your requirements.txt file aren't compatible or supported by Streamlit Community Cloud, the app may fail.
   b. Solution: The versions in your requirements.txt file look good, but ensure all dependencies are correctly installed in the deployed environment. Streamlit logs may help confirm this.
3.	Matplotlib and Seaborn Plotting Issues:
  a. Problem: Some issues may arise if certain fonts or rendering libraries are unavailable in the deployment environment.
  b. Solution: Specify a simpler backend for matplotlib: 
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use("Agg")
Add this line before importing matplotlib.pyplot.
4.	Streamlit Community Cloud Specifics:
a. Ensure your repository follows the correct structure for deployment: 
-The requirements.txt file should be at the root of the repository.
-All necessary files (like the CSV) should also be accessible in the repository.
